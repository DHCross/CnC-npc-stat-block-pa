Perfect — then it needs to be broadened just a touch, so it applies **universally** to any *Castles & Crusades* spell: druidic, clerical, arcane, psionic, rune-based, or homebrew.

Here’s the refined and fully generalized version — the one that should live in your style bible and dev documentation as the **official master rule set for all C&C spell text creation**.

---

# **Castles & Crusades Spell Formatting Guide (Canonical PHB Standard)**

*Applies to all new or converted spells for official and compatible publications.*

---

### **1. Title Line**

* The **spell name** appears in **bold small caps** (or all caps if small caps unavailable).
  Example: **HEAT ANY ALLOY**

* Immediately below it, list the **class and spell level** in **bold italic**.
  Example: *Level 2 Druid* or *Level 3 Wizard*

* If the spell has a type or descriptor—*Reforged Spell*, *Rune*, *Cantrip*, *Invocation*, etc.—place it after the name, separated by a comma.
  Example: **ARREST MOTION**, *Reforged Spell*

---

### **2. Introductory Italic Paragraph**

* The first paragraph after the title is **italicized** and written in **narrative tone**.
* It sets the sensory, emotional, or mythic atmosphere of the magic—one to three sentences.
  Example:
  *The rune hums with restrained tension, freezing the world mid-motion until the air itself grows still.*

This paragraph is optional for mundane utility spells but strongly recommended for all narrative or elemental magic.

---

### **3. Descriptive and Mechanical Body**

* The body is **regular prose**, never bullets, tables, or stat blocks.
* Write in **third person**: “The caster,” “the cleric,” or “the rune mark,” never “you.”
* Blend flavor and mechanics in natural sentences. Do not isolate mechanics in lists.
* **Dice notation** (1d4, 2d6, etc.) is written inline.
* **Units** are written out as words: “feet,” “rounds,” “turns,” “minutes,” “hours.”
* When describing escalating or sequential effects, use chronological phrasing (“By the third round, the heat grows unbearable...”).
* **Bold** internal keywords like **Range**, **Duration**, **Saving Throw**, or **Components** only when they appear in running text for emphasis—never with colons or line breaks.

---

### **4. Mechanical Summary Paragraph (PHB Narrative Form)**

* Every spell concludes with a **single prose paragraph** summarizing its mechanical data.
* Each key term is **bolded** and seamlessly integrated into grammatical sentences.
* There are **no colons**, **no stacked fields**, and **no “Statistics:” header**.
* Each concept is expressed as part of natural language flow.

**Example (authentic PHB style):**

> **Casting** this spell requires the caster’s combat action for the round. **The spell’s range** is 50 feet with a duration of 7 rounds. **There is no saving throw.** **The spell is unaffected by spell resistance.** **The area of effect** is 2 square feet or one individual per two caster levels. **Its components** are speech and hand gestures.

For non-combat spells, rephrase the first line to fit context:

> *Casting this spell requires a single round of concentration.*
> *Casting this spell requires both speech and touch.*

---

### **5. Sub-Spells or Variants**

* If the spell includes alternate forms (e.g., “Cool Any Alloy”), introduce them in a **new paragraph**, not as a subheading.
* Write the variant name in **italic**, followed by a colon, and one explanatory sentence.
  Example:
  *Cool any Alloy:* This spell lowers the temperature of metal instead of raising it, otherwise functioning as *Heat any Alloy*.

---

### **6. Grammar and Diction**

* Maintain a **neutral, literary tone** — clear, concise, and mythic, but never colloquial.
* Avoid parenthetical abbreviations (“CL,” “HD”) in running text; use full terms (“Challenge Level,” “Hit Dice”).
* Use the appropriate title for the caster’s tradition (“wizard,” “cleric,” “illusionist,” “rune mark,” etc.).
* Write out numbers one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above.
* Prioritize readability and cadence over rigid repetition.
  Example: “The spell lasts for seven rounds” reads better than “Duration: seven rounds.”

---

### **7. Layout and Typographic Conventions**

* Each spell is separated by **one blank line**.
* The **mechanical summary paragraph** follows directly after the description—no “Statistics:” label.
* Bold is used **only** for the spell title and for mechanical keywords within prose.
* No bullet points, tables, or dash lists.
* Measurement and timing information must always appear in the prose narrative, never as isolated data rows.

---

### **8. Continuity and Lore Alignment**

For legacy or Yggsburgh-era content:

* Preserve the **mythic cadence** — every spell reads like a short legend of cause and effect.
* Keep historical spell flavor intact, but rewrite mechanics to meet modern PHB readability.
* Maintain **consistent bold keyword usage** and **sentence rhythm** across all spells.
* Always end with the PHB-style prose mechanical summary for clarity and cross-reference consistency.

---

### **9. Cross-System Consistency (Optional)**

When referencing spells in stat blocks, NPC sheets, or conversion tables:

* Use **abbreviated OGL-style syntax** (e.g., `CT 1; R 150 ft.; Dur 1 rnd/level; SV none; SR yes.`).
* Reserve this format for database or reference tools only.
* Never include the shorthand format inside a full spell write-up.

### **Summary Table: PHB Canon Format**

| Section               | Required Form                             | Example                                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title**             | Bold small caps; descriptor italic        | **ARREST MOTION**, *Reforged Spell*                                  |
| **Intro Paragraph**   | Italicized sensory tone                   | *The rune hums with restrained tension...*                           |
| **Body**              | Descriptive prose with inline bold terms  | “Through this rune the caster halts motion...”                       |
| **Summary Paragraph** | Continuous prose sentences, bold keywords | “**Casting** this spell requires the caster’s combat action...”      |
| **Variants**          | Italic sub-form line                      | *Cool any Alloy:* Functions as *Heat any Alloy* but reverses effect. |
| **Tone**              | Third-person, concise, mythic realism     | —                                                                    |

### **10. Canonical Purpose**

This format defines the **Golden Standard** for all *Castles & Crusades* spell write-ups — including:

* Core PHB spells
* Reforged or variant systems (Runes, Invocations, Words of Power, etc.)
* Future class expansions (Illusionist revisions, Psionics, Divine Aspects, etc.)

It ensures **cross-book uniformity** and **parser-safe consistency**, while maintaining the **mythic-literate style** that defines Troll Lord Games’ house tone.
