# Magic Item Conversion Reference

## Conversion Rules

**Magic Item Conversion Rules**

### I. Naming and Formatting Mandates

*   Magic item names and their bonuses must always be **italicized**.
*   Numeric bonuses on magic items are mandated to be placed **at the end of the item name**. The conversion process must convert standard forms like "+1 longsword" into the mandated format, such as "*longsword +1*".
*   Item names must be **canonicalized** to the latest *Monsters & Treasure* (M&T) equivalents.
*   If an item name is ambiguous or uses older wording, it must be **swapped out** for a known equivalent or require a mechanical explanation.
*   Mundane gear (plain armor, ordinary weapons) should **not be italicized** unless the entire parenthetical block is italicized due to stylistic fiat.

### II. Mechanical Clarity and Description

*   A **short mechanical explanation or effect text** must be provided for unusual or unique magic items to ensure clarity for the Castle Keeper.
*   For magic items that produce spell-like effects, the mechanical explanation must include the numeric effect (e.g., an *elixir of healing* notes that it "heals 4â€“16 hit points").
*   Magic items possess **mental and physical** saving throw categories and generally make saving throws on a 12 or better against attacks.
*   Magic items add a bonus to their saving throw equal to their magical bonus (using the higher bonus if two different bonuses exist, such as +2/+5) plus +1 for every special ability the item possesses.
*   Magic items mimicking spell-like or class-like abilities have a saving throw bonus equal to the level of the ability being mimicked.

### III. Equipment Verb Standardization

Consistent verb usage is required when listing magic items in stat blocks:

*   Use the verb **"wears"** for magic armor and barding (e.g., "He wears *full plate mail +2*").
*   Use the verb **"carries"** (or carry/carries) for magic weapons, shields, gear, and treasure (e.g., "and carries a *longsword +1*").
*   Magic shields must have their **type explicitly specified** (e.g., medium steel shield, large wooden shield).

### IV. Specific Item Conversions

The following specific item names must be converted to their current canonical forms:

| Old Item Name (Original) | New Item Name (Current) | Citations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Amulet of Health** | *Amulet of Superior Health* | |
| **Amulet of Mighty Fists** | *Amulet of Mighty Blows* | |
| **Amulet of Natural Armor** | *Amulet of Bestial Armor* | |
| **Bag of Holding** | *Dimensional Pouch* | |
| **Belt of Giant Strength** | *Harness of Giant Strength* or *Belt of the Giant* | |
| **Boots of Speed** | *Boots of Flight of Foot* | |
| **Dust of Disappearance** | *Dust of Vanishing* | |
| **Potion of Protection from Alignment** | *Potion of Protection from Disposition* | |
| **Ring of Detect Alignment** | *Ring of Detect Disposition* | |
| **Robe of Protection** | *Robe of Armor* or *Robe +3* | |
| **Scroll of Anti-Magic Shell** | *Scroll of Anti-Magic Sphere* | |
| **Vanishing Powder** | *Dust of Disappearance* (or *Dust of Vanishing*) | |
| **Well of Many Worlds** | *Portable Portal* | |

### V. Stylistic Fiat (Appendix I/J)

*   Under Jeremey's Editorial Fiat, when presenting item details in the dense compendium style (Appendix I or J), the canonical house style allows and encourages the **entire abbreviated parenthetical block to be italicized as a whole**.
*   This rule overrides the standard practice and means that mundane items listed within that specific block (e.g., "leather armor") may appear italicized.
