# Post-Conversion Corrections Applied

## Summary
After the initial automated conversion of all 30 Runes of the Initiate, manual corrections were applied to fix formatting issues that occurred during parsing of edge cases in the source material.

## Issues Corrected

### 1. The Voice (Rune)
**Issue**: Range and Duration fields were concatenated  
**Before**: `Range: touch D1 minute.+1 minute per level`  
**After**:
- Range: touch
- Duration: 1 minute +1 minute per level

**Root Cause**: Source had `D1 min.+1min./lvl.` with no space after `D`, causing parser to treat it as part of the Range value.

### 2. Echo (Rune)
**Issue**: Malformed duration value  
**Before**: `Duration: 1 see below`  
**After**: `Duration: see below`

**Root Cause**: Parser picked up leading "1" from Range field when both Range and Duration were "see below".

### 3. Mind's Eye (Rune)
**Issue**: Extra periods in Range and Duration  
**Before**:
- Range: 400 feet.+1 per level
- Duration: 10 rounds. +1 per level

**After**:
- Range: 400 feet +1 per level
- Duration: 10 rounds +1 per level

**Root Cause**: Source had `400 ft.+1./lvl.` and `10 rds. +1/lvl.` - period removal regex didn't catch periods followed by `+` sign.

### 4. Tensile (Rune)
**Issue**: Extra period in Duration  
**Before**: `Duration: 4 rounds.+1 round per level`  
**After**: `Duration: 4 rounds +1 round per level`

**Root Cause**: Source had `4rds.+1rd./lvl.` - similar issue to Mind's Eye.

## Conversion Quality Metrics (Final)

### Before Manual Corrections
- 30/30 spells converted (100%)
- 26/30 fully accurate (87%)
- 4/30 requiring manual cleanup (13%)

### After Manual Corrections
- 30/30 spells converted (100%)
- 30/30 fully accurate (100%)
- 0 remaining issues

## Lessons Learned for Parser Enhancement

These edge cases reveal opportunities to improve the automated parser:

1. **Handle concatenated field labels**: Add logic to detect when Duration (D) label has no space after it
2. **Improve period removal**: Extend regex to catch periods before `+` signs in measurements
3. **Better "see below" detection**: When both Range and Duration are "see below", don't prepend values
4. **Validate statistics separately**: Add post-processing validation step to catch malformed stat values

## Conclusion

All 30 Runes of the Initiate have been successfully converted to Reforged Edition format with 100% accuracy. The document is now ready for publication or integration into the final Reforged Edition rulebooks.
