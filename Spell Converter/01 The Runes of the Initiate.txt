The Runes of the Initiate: These are the Foundation. These are common runes, and they are without number. They are the runes that most rune marks use and begin play with.

Runes of the Initiate

**Arrest Motion** **(Chr) (Roan** **ot** **Kepulch)**

CT 1			R 150ft.		D 1 rd./lvl.

SV see below		SR yes		Comp S

Arrest motion stops objects in motion or keeps them from moving, if already motionless. It has an area of effect of 10’×10’ +5’ per level and lasts one round per level. 

The targets are held exactly as they are when the rune is activated. If they are in flight, they are held in flight. Both humans and monsters can be stopped, as can items thrown or hurled. The rune mark must make a successful charisma save for the rune to work. The caster can cast it on himself; in such cases there is no attribute check required. 

The item or person in stasis can be moved by outside influence, or in the case of a living creature, it can attempt to move itself by making a successful strength check (CL equal to the level of the rune caster) in the round following the rune’s activation. If an outside force is attempting to move the target, the source of the interference must make the strength check.

**Bend Light** **(Int) (Roan** **ot** **Amnuel)**

CT 1			R 100 ft.	D 10 min./lvl.

SV none		SR no		Comp S

Bend light allows the user to manipulate light, forcing it away from the rune’s target. It affects a 20-foot diameter sphere and lasts one turn per level. The redirected light makes the target invisible from anyone looking at it, as no light is reflected back from the target for the eye to see. It does not, of course, hide the target from any other senses, such as smell, touch, or even magical vision such as true seeing. 

BINDING (Chr) (Roan ot Paath-uk)

CT 1			R touch		D 10 min./lvl.

SV none		SR no		Comp S

Binding has many uses, as it can be used to join two mundane objects together. The binding is permanent until the rune mark releases it. Spells such as dispel magic, knock, or a similar spell can be used to break the binding. It affects one object, great or small. 

The binding rune can be used to bind a door and the door jamb, two covers of a book, torn armor, a broken sword hilt, etc. Any existing portal, magical or mundane, bound with the rune remains open. If used with the opening rune, the binding rune binds the target open, keeping a door from closing, a book from closing, etc. The rune also has broader implications, as it can be used to open or close magical portals, etc.

BOTTLE (Int) (Roan ot Ilj)

CT 2			R touch		D permanent 

SV none		SR no	 	Comp S

Bottle creates an interdimensional space within a vessel. It is permanent until dispelled magically or canceled by the rune mark. The space is shaped much like a bottle, being round and rather small. The space created is equal to one square foot for every level of the rune mark. It commonly serves the traveler as a vessel for carrying water, as it serves to hold simple substances such as liquids and gases. The space cannot be corroded, so any substance placed within it does no harm to the vessel. Bottle must be cast upon a flask, bottle, or similar container. 

BREATH (Chr) (Roan ot Higle)

CT 1			R touch		D see below

SV none		SR no		Comp S

Breath creates breathable air and is useful in almost every environment under water, in sulfurous caverns, in the Void, or on other planes where air might be in short supply or does not exist at all. The rune is cast by touching the target, living or otherwise. This rune does not expire as normal runes do, but rather creates enough air to keep an adult human alive for 24 hours. If the rune is cast upon an object, it creates a 20-foot diameter sphere. Its power dissipates, though it gives breathable air to more than one person. One adult human has enough air for 24 hours, or two adult humans for 12 hours, or three adult humans for 6 hours, etc.

COMPOSITION (Int) (Roan ot ietulth)

CT 1			R 10 ft./lvl.	D 1 rd./lvl.

SV see below		SR no		Comp S

This rune allows the user to know the substance of things. It has a range of up to 10 feet per caster level. The rune lasts one round per level. Casting the rune allows the rune mark to understand what something is composed of, i.e. what types of minerals, liquids, gases, or elements are present. He cannot determine the exact breakdown, such as percentages, ratios, or other measurements. One could ascertain if an approaching gas cloud has acid qualities within, the wood of which a door is made, the magical metal(s) within a sword, etc. Upon a second successful intelligence check (CL determined by CK), the user can determine the age of the substance in question.

If cast on magic items, the item is allowed a saving throw against the level of the user. If it fails, the user can understand the magical makeup of the item, allowing him to know its bonus power as well as any special qualities it possesses. When cast upon a living target, composition reveals the creature’s alignment. As with magic items, the target is allowed an intelligence saving throw, CL equal to the level of the rune mark; any bonus for level, attribute, or magical protection are included.

DARKNESS (Int) (Roan ot Unk)

CT 1			R 100 ft.	D see below

SV none		SR no		Comp S

Darkness extinguishes any normal, natural light source, such as fire, candles, torches, etc., in a 20-foot radius. No attribute check is required. However, for the darkness to extinguish magical light, the rune mark must make a successful attribute check, the CL equal to 10 plus the item’s bonus. In the case of a light or similar spell, the CL is equal to the level of the one who cast the light spell. Items with no bonus receive a +1/+2/+3 at the CK’s discretion. 

DRAIN HEAT (Chr) (Roan ot freaul)

CT see below		R 50 ft.		D 1 rd./lvl.

SV none		SR yes		Comp S

Drain heat draws the heat from any individual target. If cast on an object it affects 5’×5’ +5 square feet per level. The rune lasts one round per level.

The rune can be deadly, freezing the blood in the target’s veins, killing all bodily functions. In the case of torches, camp fires, and other heat-producing targets, it can cause them to fizzle out and die. Once cast, the rune mark can draw out the heat of a target for as many rounds as it survives or the rune lasts; it draws out 1d4 HP of heat per round. If cast upon an object, it draws out 1d2 HP per round, eventually making the item brittle.

Any creatures or substances caught in the cloud suffer the effects of the rune. Water freezes, rain turns to ice and snow, fingers become frostbitten, etc. The rune mark can cancel the rune at any time. If the target’s hit points are drained, the target dies, burns out, etc. The CL is adjusted by any spell or spell-like effect that might counter drain heat, such as endure elements.

ECHO (Chr) (Roan ot Arvagen)

CT 1			R see below	D 1 see below

SV none		SR yes		Comp S

This rune allows the user to rest without losing his awareness. Echo can be cast on any single individual, and remains until dispelled or forced to collapse in on the host source. 

Once activated, the rune mark is able to create a disembodied echo of his own senses: sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell. The echo remains within 10 feet of the user, watching, listening, and smelling for signs of danger. It can use the senses just as the host source would, including darkvision. The moment the echo detects something that the host source would normally construe as a threat, it wakes the host source while collapsing in on him at the same time, so that as the user wakens, the echo vanishes, and the user regains normal control of his senses. 

There is a small chance that the echo will become sentient, creating a disembodied doppelganger of its host source. Every time the rune is cast there is a 1% chance of this occurring. In such cases the echo lingers near the host source, but eventually drifts away. 

The host source suffers no apparent damage, but will from time to time, at the CK’s discretion, see what the echo sees, hear what the echo hears, etc. Anytime this happens the host source automatically suffers a -1 to all combat or rune-related rolls for so long as he experiences the echo’s senses. This usually doesn’t last more than a few rounds.

HORN OF PLENTY (Chr) (Roan ot Pfilk)

CT 1			R touch		D 1 rd./lvl.

SV see below		SR no		Comp S

When this rune is cast upon a drinking horn or similar vessel containing mead, the mead is blessed with knowledge and wisdom. The rune affects only one physical horn and lasts for five rounds +1 per caster level. Whoever drinks the entire horn gains a +1 bonus on all intelligence, charisma, and wisdom checks for the rune’s duration. Once drained, the horn may be refilled and reused, however, it takes three rounds for the new mead to become potent. Any bonuses granted from drinking a second horn are cumulative. If three horns are consumed by the same individual he must make a constitution save or pass out for 1-6 hours (CL equal to the rune mark’s level). For each horn consumed thereafter, the drinker must make a constitution save, with the CL going up by 5 each horn, as does the corresponding number of hours; for four horns he would pass out for 5 +1-6, for 5 horns, 10+1-6 hours, and so on.

LIGHT (Int) (Roan ot Mur)

CT 1			R see below	D 10 min./lvl.

SV none		SR none	Comp S

This rune sheds light that extends up to 20 feet in radius from the inscription. It lasts one turn per level.

The light’s intensity depends upon the pressure placed on the rune when it is inscribed. If the rune mark wishes the light to be dull, he inscribes the rune lightly; for more intense light, more pressure is placed when the rune is written. If vocalized, the rune’s inflection determines its intensity. The light can be dull and dim or exceedingly bright as the rune mark chooses.

LINKING (Chr) (Roan ot Lam-uk)

CT 1			R see below	D permanent

SV none		SR no		Comp S

Linking allows the rune mark to create static runes, runes that will go off with a set trigger. The area of effect of the linked runes depends upon the reactive rune, and it remains in force until the condition as set down by the conditional rune is met.

Linking is the containing rune, that rune that establishes other runes that can only be set off under certain circumstances. Any rune that can be intelligently linked to another rune can be linked. For more, see Runic Magic Defined.

LUCK (Chr) (Roan ot Erigress)

CT 1			R 50 ft.		D 1 rd./lvl.

SV none		SR no		Comp S

Luck tips the circumstances in the rune mark’s favor. The luck rune lasts for one round per level of the rune mark. It can affect only one item.

Luck changes or affects the outcome of any single event. Whoever bares the luck-inscribed rune gains its benefit. The luck can range from re-rolling a die to gaining a +1 to an attribute check; the CK must determine and adjudicate the rune’s activation.

LURE (Int) (Roan ot Loke)

CT 1			R touch		D 10 min./lvl.

SV wisdom negates	SR no		Comp S

Lure creates a pulsating point of light that attracts living things. It lasts for 2-12 rounds and affects all creatures within a 50-foot area.

The point of light is little more than a foot in diameter and puts off a very bright light equivalent to 10 torches. Any living creature that spies these beams must make a successful wisdom save or be attracted and drawn to the light at standard movement rate. Once within 20 feet of the rune/light he is held enraptured, unable to move. However, every four melee rounds he may make a second wisdom save in an attempt to break the power of the rune. If the victim is attacked, jostled, or in any way interrupted, he may make another wisdom save with a bonus of +4. 

MARKING (Chr) (Roan ot Naum)

CT 2			R touch		D permanent

SV none		SR no		Comp S

Marking magically places the rune mark’s personal sign or symbol upon a non-magical item. The runes last for as many turns as the rune mark levels.

That sign can be any symbol, shape, or design of the rune mark’s choosing. The sign establishes a link between the item and the rune mark. Any action taken using the marked item grants the rune mark a bonus +1 to any charisma check. Other than the rune mark, anyone attempting to pick up or wield the item will struggle with its weight and suffer a -1 to all charisma checks. The rune mark can cancel the rune at any time.

MIND CALM (Int) (Roan ot Kanu)

CT 1			R touch		D 10 min./lvl.

SV intelligence for half	SR yes		Comp S

Mind calm clears one’s mind of all turbulent thoughts, allowing the caster to calm all emotions, stress, or other mental processes that might distract him. 

The rune empties the mind, creating a shield against all forms of mental attack or mental fatigue. Once activated, the caster gains +1 per level against any mental attack or mental fatigue he encounters or suffers. The rune’s specific design protects one while traveling through the Void or any other plane of entropy; it serves as well against planes of chaos, law, etc.

The “kanu rune” can also be used to mentally attack an enemy, by creating a void within his mind which wreaks havoc in the form of 2d6 points of damage. The target is allowed an intelligence save. If successful, mind calm does 1/2 damage. For this to work the rune must be inscribed upon the target’s person.

MIND’S EYE (Int) (Roan ot Nuclus)

CT 1			R 400 ft.+1./lvl.	D 10 rds. +1/lvl.

SV none		SR no		Comp S

Mind’s eye allows the wielder to see through the eyes of someone else. Mind’s eye can be inscribed on one individual only and lasts for 10 rounds +1 per level of the rune mark. 

The rune does not allow for any type of control, nor does it allow the user to read the target’s thoughts, or even grasp at the target’s interpretation of what he is seeing; it allows only the actual vision. If the target possesses twilight, dusk, or dark vision, or any magically enhanced vision such as a true seeing spell, the rune mark is able to see that as well. The rune mark must inscribe the rune upon the target.

There is a small chance that the target may discover the invasion and realize what is happening. Any target with an intelligence of 12 or greater must make a successful intelligence save, CL equal to the level of the rune mark, to notice the sorcery, and may block it with a second successful intelligence save.

NUTRIENT (Int) (Roan ot Nordfuel)

CT 1			R touch		D permanent

SV none		SR no		Comp S, M

Nutrient allows the caster to draw greater nutrition from the nord stone. It is one of the few runes which require a material component. The nord stone itself is rare and is found where receding glaciers have ground against veins of sandstone. When exposed to the sunlight, it expands and flakes (see New Magic Items). The flakes are edible and serve to heal whoever eats them for 1-2 points of damage. The rocks are very fragile, light, and dissolve when consumed.

When nutrient is cast upon a nord stone, the stone’s natural healing powers are enhanced. Whoever consumes these flakes heals 1d4 points of damage; the flakes also provide him with enough sustenance to survive for a day without food or drink. Someone may consume more than one flake to speed up healing time, but he will not feed himself for more than a day. For example, consuming two flakes of the stone at the same time heals 2d4 points of damage but only provides enough sustenance for one day.

The material component for this rune is a nord stone.

OFFERING (Chr) (Roan ot Hile)

CT 1			R touch		D see below

SV none		SR no	Comp S

Offering allows the rune mark to give of himself or another willing subject. Carving the rune upon the body it allows the subject to transfer 1-2 of their hit points per level to another. 

The subject suffers the transferred damage. At 8th level the offering may consist of 1-4 attribute points per week. Any losses the subject suffers are healed normally, or in the case of attribute points, 1 per week. Unless used with another rune that allows it, at no point may the recipient of the offering exceed their normal amount of hit points or attribute points. 

OPENING (Chr) (Roan ot Kast)

CT 1			R 100 ft.	D immediate

SV none		SR yes		Comp S

This simple rune breaks magical bindings. It affects one bound item. Its duration is immediate.

Once carved, opening breaks wizard locks, hold portals, and similar spells, as well as the binding rune. It can also overcome doors held by riddles, etc. if the rune mark a successful charisma check (CL equal to the level of the spell caster). 

PILLARS (Chr) (Roan ot Hugin)

CT 4			R 100 ft.	D permanent

SV none		SR no		Comp S

Pillars strengthens walls, pillars, battlements, and similar structures, as well as anything that bears weight, from simple canes and walking sticks to posts. 

The rune increases the strength and durability of the item on which it is inscribed, effectively doubling its strength. If it is a door with 4 hit points, the rune grants it another 4. If it is a pillar that can support 1,000 pounds, it would hold up 2,000 pounds. For every 10 levels of the rune mark, the rune also imparts SR 1 to the item in question, protecting it against magical attacks. 

REDIRECT (Int) (Roan ot Ahff)

CT 1			R 150 ft.	D 10 min./lvl.

SV yes			SR yes (h)	Comp S, M

Redirect forces a moving item or person in a different direction. Redirect can affect items that weigh up to 50 pounds per level of the user. Anything encountering the rune or the item upon which it is inscribed is affected.

The target cannot be made to turn back 180 degrees, but is rather deflected off its current path. The rune can move things left, right, up, down, etc., up to five feet off target. When used against human or monster targets, the rune forces any charging opponent to veer in the desired direction. Arrows, spears, and the like also move in the desired direction. 

The material component for this rune is a piece of flint.

RENDING (Chr) (Roan ot Burnetu)

CT 1			R 10 ft./lvl.	D immediate

SV strength negates	SR no		Comp S

Rending tears the target apart. The rune can impact one item, targeting up to one cubic foot per level of the rune mark. Any item upon which rending is inscribed must make a successful strength save (CL equal to the rune mark’s level) or break, splinter, or shatter. Large items may only break into a few pieces; fragile items, such as glass, shatter. The rune may be used against almost any target; it can be used in cracking a door, breaking a rock, opening a fissure in the ground, breaking swords, armor, etc. This rune has no vocal form.

REPULSION (Chr) (Roan ot Fremstod)

CT 1			R 100 ft.	D 1 rd./lvl.

SV strength negates	SR yes		Comp S

Repulsion creates a repellent field around the desired target. The rune lasts one round per level of the caster once activated. Although used on themselves by the rune masters to move through the planes, protecting them from various debris or substances they may encounter, its use is varied. It can be inscribed upon an item, a sword or shield, etc. The field creates a perfect circle that expands with time. It extends one foot per round from the target to a maximum of 20 feet. The field can move or repel items 100 pounds or greater +100 pounds per level of the caster. If an item is too large to be repelled, then the target is moved away instead. Any creature able to resist is allowed a strength check. If successful it does not move. The rune is indiscriminate, moving possessions of the rune mark, friends, etc.

SHIELDING (Chr) (Roan ot Taraj)

CT 1			R 300 ft.	D 1 rd./lvl.

SV none		SR no		Comp S

Shielding creates an extra-dimensional space around the body. The rune works on only one person at a time and lasts for one round per level of the rune mark. The extra-dimensional space shields the caster’s body from physical and magical damage by absorbing or redirecting the attack. The shield can absorb 10 hit points +1 hit point per level of physical damage on any energy-based attack, including lightning bolt, fireball, magic missile, magic arrow, etc. The extra-dimensional space is invisible until struck.

SNARE (Int) (Roan ot Nahluk)

CT 1			R 100 ft.	D 10 min./lvl.

SV strength		SR yes		Comp S

Snare creates a magical trap that can both maim and kill. The snare affects a 5’x5’ area +1 foot per level of the rune mark. Snare lasts one turn per caster level.

The rune hardens the ground, making it brittle. Anyone walking within the area of effect sets off the snare; the ground gives way, and anyone caught within the area falls into a pit several feet deep. The ground immediately hardens around them, penning them in the earth. Those caught suffer 1d4 hit points +1 hit point per level as their legs and/or torsos are crushed. Those caught in the snare can attempt to break out, which requires a successful strength check.

THREADS (Int) (Roan ot Luetfrea)

CT see below		R 1 ft./lvl.	D see below

SV none		SR no		Comp S

Threads draws out threads of ice from very small amounts of moisture. This rune can be inscribed in the air at first level. It lasts indefinitely or until destroyed.

These threads extend out from a point of the user’s choosing; the user must touch the point where the threads begin. The threads of ice are extraordinarily strong, able to hold or pull a tremendous amount of weight. Threads is generally used to hold items or people, for it lasts until dispelled or destroyed by the user. It serves those who travel on the planes as a floating disk, for multiple castings will produce several threads which are easy to weave into a platform. The rune has other applications as well. It can, for instance, be used to create restraints and rope, or to bind doors, etc. The spell may also be used as a weapon, freezing the moisture in a target’s mouth, etc.

For every ounce of water the user possesses or has access to, he is able to freeze 100 feet of ice; the thread is no thicker than the lead of an ordinary pencil and is practically invisible. The ice requires one round per 10 feet to freeze. The resulting thread is very light, with every 100 feet weighing about 1 pound. The thread is very malleable, able to be coiled, rolled up, etc. It is, however, easily entangled with other threads, as it is lightweight and very difficult to see. Several threads can be joined together, but this is difficult and time consuming, requiring a successful dexterity check (CL 10). Each thread so joined requires one turn to do so. Creating a platform can be a long and arduous task. The threads possess tremendous strength, able to hold up to 20 pounds per foot.

The icy threads are highly susceptible to heat and exposure to sun light; a single thread must make a saving throw each round it is exposed to any form of heat, including sunlight. Challenge base for the save is 18, CL determined by the CK; the spell caster adds his own level and intelligence attribute bonus to the save. If it fails, the ice dissolves instantly into gas. Ambient light cast by magic items and magical spells such as light do not affect the thread. However, the magic spells flame shield or fireball will affect the threads. A dispel magic spell can destroy the threads, and the user himself may cancel the rune.

TENSILE (Int) (Roan ot Hugrun)

CT 1			R 150 ft.	D 4rds.+1rd./lvl.

SV none		SR no		Comp S

Tensile doubles the strength of rope, chain, string, etc. The rune lasts four rounds +1 round per level of the caster. The rune only affects one item, and the item cannot be more than 100 pounds in weight.

Tensile can be applied to almost any item such as wood and steel, making the item stronger. Any items the spell targets double in strength. Rope is able to hold twice the weight, a wheel is able to carry twice the amount before breaking, etc. Any melee weapon upon which the rune is cast gains a +1 bonus to hit and damage, and armor gains +1 bonus to AC. It can affect magic weapons as well as other spells and runes such as threads. 

THE VOICE (Chr) (Roan ot Oethule)

CT 1			R touch		D1 min.+1min./lvl.

SV none		SR no		Comp S

This rune is etched upon the throat, and when done correctly, intones the voice with magic. It lasts 1 minute +1 minute per level. It affects all who can hear it.

The wielder’s voice becomes deep and measured. It adopts a melodic, almost hypnotic tone for any who can hear it, altering the speaker’s normal speech patterns in order to appeal to others, no matter their cultural, social, racial, or linguistic backgrounds, and changing even to account for social nuances such as religion and emotive responses. The wielder of the rune gains a +2 on all charisma checks, and those to whom the voice is directed become calm and very reluctant to attack the wielder. They will only do so if they are attacked by the wielder or any of those who serve him. Furthermore, they become susceptible to mind-altering spells and simple verbal suggestions, suffering a -2 on all charisma, wisdom, or intelligence saving throws or attribute checks. As the rune mark increases in level, the power of the voice does so as well. At 5th level the bonus rises to +4 and the penalty to -4. At 10th level this increases to +8/-8, respectively. 

WEIGHTLESSNESS (Roan ot Illtut)

CT 1			R touch		D 10 min./lvl.

SV none		SR no		Comp S

Weightlessness reduces the weight of the item upon which the rune is scribed. The weight of the item in question (and any contents within) is reduced by 25 pounds +10 per level per level of the rune mark. Weightlessness can be inscribed upon a living creature, but if so, it does not affect the items worn. If, however, it is cast upon the armor the person is wearing, the armor is considered to contain the person and the whole; both armor and person’s weight are reduced. An axe in the person’s hand would not, however, be affected by the rune. It does not reduce the encumbrance of additional items on the person
