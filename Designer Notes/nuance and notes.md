The specific observation Stephen Chenault made regarding your NPC Parser Toolkit highlighted two crucial gaps during the test conversion: the failure to list the NPC’s spells and her **"significant attribute"**.

Despite these omissions, Stephen was profoundly impressed, calling the overall function of the tool **"f****** amazing"** and acknowledging that the conversion of the primary stat block data was done **"correctly"**.

Here is a detailed discussion of the two missing elements—Significant Attributes and Spell Lists—and the editorial context surrounding them:

### 1. Significant Attribute Failure

Stephen identified the concept of a "significant attribute" as any ability score **over 12** that grants a bonus or a minus. This information is considered vital for quick reference by the Castle Keeper (CK) when running an NPC.

*   **The Missing Data:** In the random NPC Stephen tested, the tool failed to pull and list her significant attribute, which was **Wisdom 15**. Stephen explained that if the NPC also had a high Charisma (e.g., Charisma 17), that score should also be listed.
*   **Context in Other Stat Blocks:** This convention of listing high scores is visible in other NPC entries found in the sources. For example, a character identified as **The Torturer (human 7th level fighter)** has his high scores explicitly listed: "His **significant attributes are strength 17 and constitution 17**".
*   **Formatting Requirement:** The tool’s core function is to convert the raw data into a narrative-ready, complete sentence format. While the tool successfully formatted core data like Hit Points and Armor Class, integrating these high attribute scores into the final descriptive block remained a necessary step that was missed in the test.

### 2. Spells Not Listed

The second critical issue was that the automated process **"didn't list her spells"**.

*   **Tool’s Intended Capability:** Your toolkit is a specialized resource designed to handle NPC and monster data, and it is pre-loaded with a dictionary that includes **378 spells**. The fact that the spells did not appear suggests an issue either with how the raw text input was structured for that specific NPC, or a logic gap in the parser that failed to identify the spell block for conversion.
*   **The Formatting Goal:** Stephen’s overall excitement stemmed from the tool's potential to quickly reformat spell information into the required new layout, which involves taking the raw stat block data and placing it **"in complete sentence form and then bolding the you know whatever"** necessary elements for the *Castles & Crusades Player’s Handbook* style.
*   **Immediate Remediation:** Immediately after observing the tool working, Stephen requested that you use it to convert **30 specific "rune spells"**. This task focused on using the parser's advanced formatting capabilities to take raw spell text and reformat it for the modern layout, saving what Stephen anticipated would be **"a mountain of man-hours"**.

### 3. Editorial Context: The Spell Listing Debate

The omission of spells touches upon an internal editorial debate at Troll Lord Games regarding how much spell information should be included in NPC stat blocks:

*   **Stephen’s Preference for Omission:** Stephen expressed that he **"wanted us to stop listening spells period"** in NPC stat blocks. His preferred format would only list spell capacity (e.g., "zero level three, first level two, second level one") and let the Castle Keeper (CK) select the specific spells.
*   **Reasoning for Omission:** This strict approach was advocated to reduce potential complaints from players and reviewers who **"find time little mistakes,"** such as miscategorized spell levels in the stat block. Stephen’s desire to convert data into complete sentences was similarly driven by complaints about small punctuation errors in d20 stat blocks.
*   **Internal Disagreement:** Stephen acknowledged that **Jeremy and Chuck disagreed** with his idea to entirely omit specific spell listings.

In summary, the parser successfully achieved the demanding **structural conversion** (complete sentences and bolding), but the noted failures involved the **mechanical identification and listing** of high attributes and specific spells—both of which are necessary data points for a fully functional NPC entry, regardless of the internal editorial debate over how detailed those spell listings should be.
