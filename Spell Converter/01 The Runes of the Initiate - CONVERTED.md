# RUNES OF THE INITIATE - REFORGED EDITION

These are the Foundation. These are common runes, and they are without number.

---

**ARREST MOTION**, Reforged Spell
_Chr Roan ot Kepulch_

*Bound to the elements of motion and stillness, the rune hums with tension, halting the rush of movement as if time itself forgot to breathe.*

Arrest motion stops objects in motion or keeps them from moving, if already motionless. It has an area of effect of 10 feet by 10 feet, plus 5 feet to each side per level, and lasts one round per level.

The targets are held exactly as they are when the rune is activated. If they are in flight, they are held in flight. Both humans and monsters can be stopped, as can items thrown or hurled. The caster can cast it on himself; in such cases there is no attribute check required.

The item or person in stasis can be moved by outside influence, or in the case of a living creature, it can attempt to move itself by making a successful Strength check in the round following the rune's activation. The challenge level equals the level of the rune caster. If an outside force is attempting to move the target, the source of the interference must make the Strength check.

**Casting Time:** 1 round. **Range:** 150 feet. **Duration:** 1 round per level. **Saving Throw:** Caster Charisma check to activate; Strength negates movement. **Spell Resistance:** Yes (creatures only). **Area of Effect:** 10 feet by 10 feet, plus 5 feet to each side per level. **Components:** Speech and gesture.

---

**BEND LIGHT**, Reforged Spell
_Int Roan ot Amnuel_

*The air shimmers and bends, as if reality itself turns aside, and where light once fell, now only shadow remains—a cloak woven from absence.*

Bend light allows the user to manipulate light, forcing it away from the rune's target. It affects a 20-foot diameter sphere and lasts one turn per level. The redirected light makes the target invisible from anyone looking at it, as no light is reflected back from the target for the eye to see. It does not hide the target from any other senses, such as smell, touch, or even magical vision such as true seeing.

**Casting Time:** 1 round. **Range:** 100 feet. **Duration:** 10 minutes per level. **Saving Throw:** None. **Spell Resistance:** No. **Area of Effect:** 20-foot diameter sphere. **Components:** Speech and gesture.

---

**BIND**, Reforged Spell
_Chr Roan ot Paath-uk_

*Threads of force knit together what was sundered, or hold fast what wishes to part—the rune remembers wholeness, and commands it to remain.*

Binding has many uses, as it can be used to join two mundane objects together. The binding is permanent until the rune mark releases it. Spells such as dispel magic, knock, or a similar spell can be used to break the binding. It affects one object, great or small.

The binding rune can be used in two modes: Bind Closed seals two surfaces together such as a door and jamb, book covers, torn armor, or a broken sword hilt. Bind Open holds an existing portal open, preventing a door from closing, a book from closing, etc. Both modes are broken by dispel magic, knock, or the rune mark's release.

**Casting Time:** 1 round. **Range:** Touch. **Duration:** Permanent (until released or dispelled). **Saving Throw:** None. **Spell Resistance:** No. **Area of Effect:** One object. **Components:** Speech and gesture.

---

**BOTTLE**, Reforged Spell
_Int Roan ot Ilj_

*A fold in space opens within the vessel, creating a pocket that exists nowhere and everywhere at once—a refuge from corrosion, a sanctuary for the carried.*

Bottle creates an interdimensional space within a vessel. It is permanent until dispelled magically or canceled by the rune mark. The space is shaped much like a bottle, being round and rather small. The space created is equal to one square foot for every level of the rune mark. It commonly serves the traveler as a vessel for carrying water, as it serves to hold simple substances such as liquids and gases. The space cannot be corroded, so any substance placed within it does no harm to the vessel. Bottle must be cast upon a flask, bottle, or similar container.

**Casting Time:** 2 rounds. **Range:** Touch. **Duration:** Permanent. **Saving Throw:** None. **Spell Resistance:** No. **Area of Effect:** One vessel. **Components:** Speech and gesture.

**Breath**, Reforged Spell
_Chr Roan ot Higle_

*Description:* Breath creates breathable air and is useful in almost every environment under water, in sulfurous caverns, in the Void, or on other planes where air might be in short supply or does not exist at all. The rune is cast by touching the target, living or otherwise. This rune does not expire as normal runes do, but rather creates enough air to keep an adult human alive for 24 hours. If the rune is cast upon an object, it creates a 20-foot diameter sphere of breathable air for up to 24 creature-hours total. Its power dissipates among multiple creatures: one adult human has enough air for 24 hours, two adult humans for 12 hours, three adult humans for 6 hours, etc.

Statistics:
- Casting Time: 1
- Range: Touch
- Duration: Special (creates 24 hours of breathable air for one adult; divides proportionally among multiple creatures)
- Saving Throw: None
- Spell Resistance: No

**Composition**, Reforged Spell
_Int Roan ot ietulth_

*Description:* This rune allows the user to know the substance of things. It has a range of up to 10 feet per caster level. The rune lasts one round per level. Casting the rune allows the rune mark to understand what something is composed of, i.e. what types of minerals, liquids, gases, or elements are present. He cannot determine the exact breakdown, such as percentages, ratios, or other measurements. One could ascertain if an approaching gas cloud has acid qualities within, the wood of which a door is made, the magical metal(s) within a sword, etc. Upon a second successful Intelligence check (CL determined by CK), the user can determine the age of the substance in question.

*Effect:* If cast on magic items, the item is allowed a saving throw against the level of the user. If it fails, the user can understand the magical makeup of the item, allowing him to know its bonus power as well as any special qualities it possesses. When cast upon a living target, composition reveals the creature's alignment. As with magic items, the target is allowed an Intelligence saving throw, CL equal to the level of the rune mark; any bonus for level, attribute, or magical protection are included.

Statistics:
- Casting Time: 1
- Range: 10 feet per level
- Duration: 1 round per level

**Darkness**, Reforged Spell
_Int Roan ot Unk_

*Description:* Darkness extinguishes any normal, natural light source, such as fire, candles, torches, etc., in a 20-foot radius. No attribute check is required for mundane light. However, for the darkness to extinguish magical light, the rune mark must make a successful attribute check: CL = 10 + magic item bonus; vs. spell light, CL = opposing caster level. Non-magical magic items use CL 11 (minor trinket), CL 13 (standard item), or CL 15 (greater item).

Statistics:
- Casting Time: 1
- Range: 100 feet
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Saving Throw: None
- Spell Resistance: No

**Drain Heat**, Reforged Spell
_Chr Roan ot freaul_

*Description:* Drain heat draws the heat from any individual target. If cast on an object it affects 5 ft. × 5 ft., +5 square feet per level. The rune lasts one round per level.

*Effect:* The rune can be deadly, freezing the blood in the target's veins, killing all bodily functions. In the case of torches, camp fires, and other heat-producing targets, it can cause them to fizzle out and die. Once cast, the rune mark can draw out the heat of a target for as many rounds as it survives or the rune lasts; targets take 1d4 hit points of cold damage each round. If cast upon an object, it takes 1d2 hit points per round, eventually making the item brittle.

Any creatures or substances caught in the area suffer the effects of the rune. Water freezes, rain turns to ice and snow, fingers become frostbitten, etc. The rune mark can cancel the rune at any time. If the target's hit points are drained, the target dies, burns out, etc. The CL is adjusted by any spell or spell-like effect that might counter drain heat, such as endure elements.

Statistics:
- Casting Time: 1
- Range: 50 feet
- Duration: 1 round per level
- Saving Throw: Constitution negates (per round)
- Spell Resistance: Yes
- Components: S

**Echo**, Reforged Spell
_Chr Roan ot Arvagen_

*Description:* This rune allows the user to rest without losing his awareness. Echo can be cast on any single individual, and remains until dispelled or forced to collapse in on the host source.

*Effect:* Once activated, the rune mark is able to create a disembodied echo of his own senses: sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell. The echo remains within 10 feet of the user, watching, listening, and smelling for signs of danger. It can use the senses just as the host source would, including darkvision. The moment the echo detects something that the host source would normally construe as a threat, it wakes the host source while collapsing in on him at the same time, so that as the user wakens, the echo vanishes, and the user regains normal control of his senses.

There is a small chance that the echo will become sentient, creating a disembodied doppelganger of its host source. Every time the rune is cast there is a 1% chance of this occurring. In such cases the echo lingers near the host source, but eventually drifts away.

The host source suffers no apparent damage, but will from time to time, at the CK's discretion, see what the echo sees, hear what the echo hears, etc. During bleed-through, the host source automatically suffers –1 to attack rolls and rune checks for several rounds (CK adjudication).

Statistics:
- Casting Time: 1
- Range: Self (echo remains within 10 ft.)
- Duration: Permanent (until triggered or dispelled)
- Saving Throw: None
- Spell Resistance: Yes
- Components: S

**Horn Of Plenty**, Reforged Spell
_Chr Roan ot Pfilk_

*Description:* When this rune is cast upon a drinking horn or similar vessel containing mead, the mead is blessed with knowledge and wisdom. The rune affects only one physical horn and lasts for 5 rounds +1 per caster level. Whoever drinks the entire horn gains a +1 bonus on all Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom checks for the rune's duration. Once drained, the horn may be refilled and reused, however, it takes three rounds for the new mead to become potent. Any bonuses granted from drinking a second horn are cumulative. If three horns are consumed by the same individual he must make a Constitution save or pass out for 1d6 hours (CL equal to the rune mark's level). For each horn consumed thereafter, the drinker must make a Constitution save, with the CL going up by +5 each horn; for four horns he would be unconscious for 5 +1d6 hours, for 5 horns, 10 +1d6 hours, and so on.

Statistics:
- Casting Time: 1
- Range: Touch
- Duration: 5 rounds +1 round per level

**Light**, Reforged Spell
_Int Roan ot Mur_

*Description:* This rune sheds light that extends up to 20 feet in radius from the inscription. It lasts one turn per level.

*Effect:* The light's intensity depends upon the pressure placed on the rune when it is inscribed. If the rune mark wishes the light to be dull, he inscribes the rune lightly; for more intense light, more pressure is placed when the rune is written. If vocalized, the rune's inflection determines its intensity. The light can be dull and dim or exceedingly bright as the rune mark chooses.

Statistics:
- Casting Time: 1
- Range: Touch (object or glyph)
- Duration: 10 minutes per level
- Saving Throw: None
- Spell Resistance: No

**Linking**, Reforged Spell
_Chr Roan ot Lam-uk_

*Effect:* Linking is the containing rune, that rune that establishes other runes that can only be set off under certain circumstances. Any rune that can be intelligently linked to another rune can be linked. For more, see Runic Magic Defined.

*Description:* Lure creates a pulsating point of light that attracts living things. It lasts for 2d6 rounds and affects all creatures within a 50-foot area.

*Effect:* The point of light is little more than a foot in diameter and puts off a very bright light equivalent to 10 torches. Any living creature that spies these beams must make a successful Wisdom save or be attracted and drawn to the light at standard movement rate. Once within 20 feet of the rune/light he is held enraptured, unable to move. However, every four melee rounds he may make a second Wisdom save in an attempt to break the power of the rune.

**Marking**, Reforged Spell
_Chr Roan ot Naum_

*Description:* Marking magically places the rune mark's personal sign or symbol upon a non-magical item. The runes last for as many turns as the rune mark levels.

*Effect:* That sign can be any symbol, shape, or design of the rune mark's choosing. The sign establishes a link between the item and the rune mark.

**Mind Calm**, Reforged Spell
_Int Roan ot Kanu_

*Description:* Mind calm clears one's mind of all turbulent thoughts, allowing the caster to calm all emotions, stress, or other mental processes that might distract him.

*Effect:* The rune empties the mind, creating a shield against all forms of mental attack or mental fatigue. Once activated, the caster gains +1 per level against any mental attack or mental fatigue he encounters or suffers. The rune's specific design protects one while traveling through the Void or any other plane of entropy; it serves as well against planes of chaos, law, etc.

The “kanu rune” can also be used to mentally attack an enemy, by creating a void within his mind which wreaks havoc in the form of 2d6 points of damage. The target is allowed an intelligence save. If successful, mind calm does 1/2 damage. For this to work the rune must be inscribed upon the target's person.

*Description:* Mind's eye allows the wielder to see through the eyes of someone else. Mind's eye can be inscribed on one individual only and lasts for 10 rounds +1 per level of the rune mark.

*Effect:* The rune does not allow for any type of control, nor does it allow the user to read the target's thoughts, or even grasp at the target's interpretation of what he is seeing; it allows only the actual vision. If the target possesses twilight, dusk, or dark vision, or any magically enhanced vision such as a true seeing spell, the rune mark is able to see that as well. The rune mark must inscribe the rune upon the target.

There is a small chance that the target may discover the invasion and realize what is happening.

**Nutrient**, Reforged Spell
_Int Roan ot Nordfuel_

*Description:* Nutrient allows the caster to draw greater nutrition from the nord stone. It is one of the few runes which require a material component. The nord stone itself is rare and is found where receding glaciers have ground against veins of sandstone. When exposed to the sunlight, it expands and flakes (see New Magic Items). The flakes are edible and serve to heal whoever eats them for 1d2 points of damage. The rocks are very fragile, light, and dissolve when consumed.

*Effect:* When nutrient is cast upon a nord stone, the stone's natural healing powers are enhanced. Whoever consumes these flakes heals 1d4 points of damage; the flakes also provide him with enough sustenance to survive for a day without food or drink. Someone may consume more than one flake to speed up healing time, but he will not feed himself for more than a day. For example, consuming two flakes of the stone at the same time heals 2d4 points of damage but only provides enough sustenance for one day.

The material component for this rune is a nord stone.

**Threads**, Reforged Spell
_Int Roan ot Luetfrea_

*Description:* Threads draws out threads of ice from very small amounts of moisture. This rune can be inscribed in the air at first level. It lasts indefinitely or until destroyed.

*Effect:* These threads extend out from a point of the user's choosing; the user must touch the point where the threads begin. The threads of ice are extraordinarily strong, able to hold or pull a tremendous amount of weight. Threads is generally used to hold items or people, for it lasts until dispelled or destroyed by the user. It serves those who travel on the planes as a floating disk, for multiple castings will produce several threads which are easy to weave into a platform. The rune has other applications as well. It can, for instance, be used to create restraints and rope, or to bind doors, etc. The spell may also be used as a weapon, freezing the moisture in a target's mouth, etc.

For every ounce of water the user possesses or has access to, he is able to freeze 100 feet of ice; the thread is no thicker than the lead of an ordinary pencil and is practically invisible. The ice requires one round per 10 feet to freeze. The resulting thread is very light, with every 100 feet weighing about 1 pound. The thread is very malleable, able to be coiled, rolled up, etc. It is, however, easily entangled with other threads, as it is lightweight and very difficult to see. Several threads can be joined together, but this is difficult and time consuming, requiring a successful Dexterity check (CL 10). Each thread so joined requires one turn to do so. Creating a platform can be a long and arduous task. The threads possess tremendous strength, able to hold up to 20 pounds per foot.

The icy threads are highly susceptible to heat and exposure to sun light; a single thread must make a saving throw each round it is exposed to any form of heat, including sunlight. Challenge base for the save is 18, CL determined by the CK; the spell caster adds his own level and Intelligence attribute bonus to the save. If it fails, the ice dissolves instantly into gas. Ambient light cast by magic items and magical spells such as light do not affect the thread. However, the magic spells flame shield or fireball will affect the threads. A dispel magic spell can destroy the threads, and the user himself may cancel the rune.

Statistics:
- Casting Time: 1 round per 10 ft. created
- Range: Touch (to starting point); 1 ft. per level
- Duration: Permanent (until destroyed or dispelled)
- Saving Throw: None
- Spell Resistance: No
- Components: S

*Effect:* Tensile can be applied to almost any item such as wood and steel, making the item stronger. Any items the spell targets double in strength. Rope is able to hold twice the weight, a wheel is able to carry twice the amount before breaking, etc. Any melee weapon upon which the rune is cast gains a +1 bonus to hit and damage, and armor gains +1 bonus to AC.

**The Voice**, Reforged Spell
_Chr Roan ot Oethule_

*Description:* This rune is etched upon the throat, and when done correctly, intones the voice with magic. It lasts 1 minute +1 minute per level. It affects all who can hear it.

*Effect:* The wielder's voice becomes deep and measured. It adopts a melodic, almost hypnotic tone for any who can hear it, altering the speaker's normal speech patterns in order to appeal to others, no matter their cultural, social, racial, or linguistic backgrounds, and changing even to account for social nuances such as religion and emotive responses. The wielder of the rune gains a +2 on all Charisma checks, and those to whom the voice is directed become calm and very reluctant to attack the wielder. Targets refrain from initiating hostile actions unless provoked. Furthermore, they become susceptible to mind-altering spells and simple verbal suggestions, suffering a –2 on all Charisma, Wisdom, or Intelligence saving throws or attribute checks. As the rune mark increases in level, the power of the voice does so as well. At 5th level the bonus rises to +4 and the penalty to –4. At 10th level this increases to +8/–8, respectively.

- Casting Time: 1

_Roan ot Illtut_

*Description:* Weightlessness reduces the weight of the item upon which the rune is scribed.

Weightlessness can be inscribed upon a living creature, but if so, it does not affect the items worn. If, however, it is cast upon the armor the person is wearing, the armor is considered to contain the person and the whole; both armor and person's weight are reduced. An axe in the person's hand would not, however, be affected by the rune. It does not reduce the encumbrance of additional items on the person unless they bear the rune.
