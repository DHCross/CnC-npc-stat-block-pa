Confirmed Editorial Mandates
Spell-list Policy:

For NPC stat blocks: Use capacity summary format (e.g., "0-5, 1st-5, 2nd-5...")
For PHB spell descriptions: Include full spell description text
Note: There's an internal debate between Stephen (prefers capacity) vs. Jeremy/Chuck
Bolding Rules:

For NPC stat blocks: Never bold anything inside parenthetical stat blocks
For headings: Bold only the heading/title line of NPCs or monsters
For PHB spell layout: Bold key mechanical terms (spell name, casting time, range, etc.)
Significant Attributes:

Threshold: >12 (13+) as defined by Stephen
Format: Use "Attribute Name and Score" (e.g., "wisdom 15") without showing modifiers
Example: "His significant attributes are constitution 13, dexterity 14, and charisma 15"
